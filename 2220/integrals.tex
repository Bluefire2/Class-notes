An integral in one variable is the area under a curve, and it is calculated by multiplying the infinitesimal area of each ``line'' at $x$ by the infinitesimal change in $x$, $\diff x$, and addimg them up. Similarly, an integral in two variables, is a volume, and it is calculated by multiplying all of the areas at each point $x$ and multiplying by $\diff x$. Each of these areas is $\int f(x, y) \diff y$, so the total volume is $\int \int f(x, y) \diff y \diff x$.
