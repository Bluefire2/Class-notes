<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Racism is a very sensitive issue in the United States. For most people, it is quite scary to write any form of
extended argument about anything to do with this issue, and as a result, most writers are very careful
with what they say. This issue has, therefore, a dynamic like no other, where those who are
not afraid to make their point often view their work in a more positive light than it actually
deserves: so few have talked about racism in such depth, the logic goes, that this new discourse
must be revolutionary, and thus is worth taking seriously. As if the issue wasn't already vastly
polarising, this factor further adds to the complete lack of consensus on almost anything; it is very
common for two reputed and educated academics to have no qualms with disagreeing with each
other on an otherwise simple topic. Such an example is that of Ta-Nehisi Coates and Asad
Haider.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   Seemingly, on the surface, Haider and Coates are mostly in agreement. A blind reading - ignoring all
mentions of Coates by name - would suggest that they both agree that racism is an issue, that it is a serious
issue, that many people try to mask it with other issues to avoid it, and that something needs to be done
about it. Coates argues:
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >It is often said that Trump has no real ideology, which is not true - his ideology is
      white supremacy, in all its truculent and sanctimonious power. Trump inaugurated his
      campaign by casting himself as the defender of white maidenhood against Mexican
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
      "rapists," only to be later alleged by multiple accusers, and by his own proud words, to
      be a sexual violator himself. White supremacy has always had a perverse sexual tint.
      <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xcoates">1</a>]</span></div>
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   Here, he essentially summarises the basis of his argument: white supremacy is very real, and yet there
is a widespread claim that it is not. "It is often said" has a strong implication here. Coates later argues that
"the scope of Trump's commitment to whiteness is matched only by the depth of popular disbelief in the
power of whiteness". In his essay, he argues that, yes, there are outright racists like the KKK,
but there is another, less obvious problem that is in actuality almost as serious if not more
so. It lies in the fact that, more often than not, people will dismiss the "power of whiteness",
and the issue of institutional racism, as blown out of proportion, and Coates would say that
people who hold these views are just as much of an issue as those who burned crosses in the
30s.
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   Haider, deep down, contrary to what he says about Coates, has absolutely no problem with
this viewpoint. He too agrees that ignoring the "power of whiteness" is a problem in and of
itself:
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >Coates goes as far as to make the extraordinary claim that before Trump, whiteness
      lay dormant   when in fact our very  rst president owned slaves while in o ce, the
       rst of eight to do so (four more were slaveowners while not in o ce). <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xhaider">2</a>]</span></div>
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   Here Haider agrees with Coates, even if he doesn't realise it. Coates does not claim that, as Haider
accuses, "before Trump, whiteness lay dormant"; in fact, he argues the exact opposite:
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >With one immediate exception, Trump's predecessors made their way to high o ce
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
      through the passive power of whiteness - that bloody heirloom which cannot ensure
      mastery of all events but can conjure a tailwind for most of them. Land theft and human
      plunder cleared the grounds for Trump's forefathers and barred others from it. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xcoates">1</a>]</span></div>
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >   Haider's confusion can perhaps be traced to the fact that Coates separates Trump from his
predecessors: "no such elegant detachment can be attributed to Donald Trump". Here, Haider forgets the
importance of context, and shows, apparently, an inability to  nish the sentence he so hastily grabs his
point from:
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >No such elegant detachment can be attributed to Donald Trump - a president who,
      more than any other, has made the awful inheritance explicit. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xcoates">1</a>]</span></div>
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   Coates here claims not that whiteness had no power before Trump, but that Trump has merely made its
already existing power more obvious, more "explicit". If Haider told Coates that every single white
president before Trump was somewhat aided by his being white, Coates would shake his hand in
agreement.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Where, then, does the disagreement between these two writers source from? In order to examine that,
one must  rst take a step back from what seems to be the main point of Coates' article, and look instead at
its shortcomings, as exempli ed by Haider. Haider argues that capitalism and racism are explicitly linked,
while much of Coates' essay is about how race and class are two separate issues, and should not be
con ated. Coates argues that, for example, Trump's support base is much better de ned by race rather
than class:
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Trump's white support was not determined by income. According to Edison Research,
      Trump won whites making less than $50,000 by 20 points, whites making $50,000
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
      to  $99,999  by  28  points,  and  whites  making  $100,000  or  more  by  14  points.  This
      shows that Trump assembled a broad white coalition that ran the gamut from Joe the
      Dishwasher to Joe the Plumber to Joe the Banker. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xcoates">1</a>]</span></div>
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   Coates' point here is perfectly valid, and though he does not cite any speci c sources, his data are
backed up by exit polls <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xexitpolls">3</a>]</span>. He subsequently uses this distinction as his reasoning for the separation of
race and class. Haider on the other hand deems this approach very shallow, and critiques Coates for
ignoring some factors, and cherrypicking others:
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >We have, then, a series of omissions, elisions, and cherry-picked targets. It is easy
      to  get  bogged  down  in  circular  debates  on  particular  details  while  missing  the
      larger  question:  why  does  Coates  deem  it  important  to  undermine  the  critique  of
      capitalism?  Why  this  target,  when  since  the  17th  century  the  resistance  to  racial
      oppression and capitalist exploitation have gone hand in hand? Why this target, when
      anti-capitalist politics, despite their recent growth, still remain politically marginal,
      their meekest expressions repressed by the bureaucracy of the Democratic Party? Why
      this target, when members of every mass socialist organization appear at anti-fascist
      demonstrations to put their bodies on the line against racism? <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xhaider">2</a>]</span></div>
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   Coates, then, views race as a one-dimensional issue, whereas Haider argues that it is anything but. This
is something that Haider criticises Coates profusely for. For example, to Haider it is unacceptable that
Coates (like Mark Lilla) reduces Martin Luther King and the signi cance of his work to that of resistance
against racism:
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >For Coates, too, King is a mascot - "the bloody heirloom remains potent even now,"
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
      he  writes,  "some   ve  decades  after  Martin  Luther  King  Jr.  was  gunned  down  on
      a  Memphis  balcony."  Missing  from  both  accounts  is  the  King  who  advanced  an
      internationalist and socialist politics, who spoke out forcefully against the Vietnam
      War  and  American  imperialism,  who  saw  the  continuation  of  the  struggle  for  civil
      rights in the Poor People's Campaign and the sanitation workers' strike by AFSCME
      Local 1733, which he had gone to Memphis to support when he was murdered. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xhaider">2</a>]</span></div>
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   Here, Haider summarises his main point. To him, the many issues that face modern-day
Americans are all connected, and what he says Coates views as di erent forms of oppression -
racist and capitalist exploitation - are really the same thing. Coates, meanwhile, strives to
separate the two, and it seems that to him, the issue of race is far more signi cant in the current
context:
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >Donald  Trump  arrived  in  the  wake  of  something  more  potent  -  an  entire  nigger
      presidency with nigger health care, nigger climate accords, and nigger justice reform,
      all of which could be targeted for destruction or redemption, thus reifying the idea of
      being white. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xcoates">1</a>]</span></div>
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   Coates suggests that the main driving force behind Trump's presidency is the desire to wipe out the
legacy of his predecessor, Barack Obama, a black man. To him, this is far more signi cant for Trump and
his support base than the actual merits of Obama's policies, and he thus concludes that Trump's agenda is
far more of a racial issue than it is one of policy. This goes back to his original idea: "It is often said that
Trump has no real ideology, which is not true - his ideology is white supremacy". Coates is no stranger to
using literary dramatisations to emphasise the signi cance of race to him, such as labelling whiteness as a
"bloody heirloom", "awful inheritance", the use of the Biblical term in "America's founding <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">sins</span>", and his
use of "nigger" above. This is another area where Haider disagrees with Coates; writing that
"politics is not a romantic tale of good and evil", and "there is no such thing as magic" <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xhaider">2</a>]</span>. He
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
ridicules Coates' article as an "ominous fable", and he disagrees that Trump's agenda is to
"[reify] the idea of being white", and reminds Coates that everything that issues of race need to
be viewed not as separate from all else, but in the context of other issues, such as those of
class.
<!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >   Having said all that, there are deep-running parallels between both Haider and Coates' views, which
Haider refuses to see because of his seemingly innate desire to disagree with Coates. Their disagreements
are mostly on minor things such as, as above, Coates' mysti cation of whiteness. As Noam Chomsky, a
linguist known for his political views, put it:
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >Well,  there's  always  a  class  war  going  on.  The  United  States,  to  an  unusual
      extent, is a business-run society, more so than others. The business classes are very
      class-conscious - they're constantly  ghting a bitter class war to improve their power
      and diminish opposition. Occasionally this is recognized. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xnoam">4</a>]</span></div>
<!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   This should ring some sort of bell in the minds of both writers. Haider would have no misgivings
agreeing that class is a very important issue that cannot be downplayed, which he accuses Coates of doing.
Coates, on the other hand, would no doubt see the eerily similar rhetoric Chomsky is using
here: the idea of some elite having power over an oppressed group, the idea that this elite
seeks to improve its standing relative to the oppressed group, oppressing them further, and the
idea that people need to be more proactive in recognising this reality. What whiteness is to
Coates is what wealth is to Chomsky (and seems to be to Haider). If the two sat down for a
lunch together, they would  nd a whole lot more common ground than they would like to
think.
